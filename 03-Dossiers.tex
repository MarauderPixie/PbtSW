\chapter{Character Creation}

\epigraph{\textit{You wanna run the shadows? Then listen, chummer, learn everything you can, cuz ignorance will kill you faster than a fireball.}}{-- Ess El El, Snake Shaman}

Creating a character is a multi-step process (don’t worry, though, it’s pretty easy). The overall process is described here; more detail is provided in each Archetype’s dossier. You’ll record the details you create on the dossier page or the supplemental “extra info” page.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Choose your archetype} \\
    There are 10 Archetypes to choose from: Adept, Face, Ex-Cop, Decker, Mage, Mercenary, Rigger, Shaman, Street Doc, and Street Samurai. You can learn more about them in the Dossiers that follow.
    
    \item \textbf{Choose your Metatype and Moves} \\
    There are 5 metatypes: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Ork, and Troll. Each metatype offers a choice of Metatype Moves.
    
    \item \textbf{Choose your Looks} \\
    Each character archetype will present options for look; you are free to make up your own as well.
    
    \item \textbf{Choose your Name and Street Name} \\
    Pick a real name and street name. You may use the lists provided in the GM Resources, or create your own.
    
    \item \textbf{Assign your Stats} \\
    You have an array of points to distribute among your stats: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1. Assign each of these freely to one of your \refname{stats}: \textit{Sharp, Hard, Steady, Smooth, Skilled}
    
    \item \textbf{Choose Equipment} \\
    Each archetype will present various weapon, spell, cyberware, and equipment options. Choose one item from each list (unless the list indicates that you may choose more than one item). Some choices, particularly cyberware, are optional.
    
    \item \textbf{Determine your Essence and Edge} \\
    Your starting Essence is equal to 6 – the Essence cost of any cyberware you have installed or choose to install. Your starting Edge is zero.
    
    \item \textbf{Choose Contacts} \\
    Everybody knows somebody. You will be presented with a list of potential contacts your character might know as a result of their experiences both before and after they became shadowrunners.
    
    \item \textbf{Establish Debts and Favors} \\
    It's dangerous in the shadows and nobody survives there for long completely on their own. Luckily, chummers help each other out - albeit not out of pure altruism, of course. A runner might live a life of freedom when compared to your average wage slave but that doesn't mean there ain't no strings attached. Take a look at the section on \refname{debts and favors} for details on how to establish them.
    
    \item \textbf{Starting Moves} \\
    Your character knows all the Core and Secondary Moves. You character also knows one or more of his or her Archetype moves. If you are given an option to choose additional moves, check off the box next to them on the character sheet.
    
    \item \textbf{Advancement} \\
    Each time you fail a roll - that is, you roll a 6 or less - you receive Karma. When you mark 5 Karma and you have downtime, you can make the Advance move.
\end{enumerate}

            ## One day, I’ll make it up to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for letting that suspect walk.
            ## I let \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ skate on a serious charge once. 
            ## Letting \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ see that evidence earned me a formal reprimand.

\subsection{The Face}
\epigraph{Living in the shadows isn’t all about big guns, major mojo, and dancing the electron two-step. Sometimes a more personal approach is needed, and that’s where the Face comes in.

\subsection{The Rigger}
\textbf{The Rigger} is a cybered-up, drek-hot driving machine. When a team needs transportation, recon, or a flying drone to blow the enemy into bloody rags, they turn to their rigger. Riggers have the capability to virtually \textit{become} any drone or vehicle by using their control rig, fusing their consciousness to the machine and operating it at its peak. Getting into and out of an op and providing a little robotic fire support is the rigger’s specialty.

\textbf{The Shaman} is a master of conjuring: summoning the spirits that dwell in the astral realm and compelling them to do the shaman’s bidding. The shaman’s spirits provide many services, from devastating combat abilities to protection from hostile intent to information and reconnaissance impossible for a mundane.

\subsubsection{CREATING A SHAMAN}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Follow through general steps 2 to 6. Some suggestions for Shaman looks: \textit{heterochromic eyes, wise eyes, sunglasses; long hair, dreadlocks, shaved head; street clothes, anachronistic clothes, biker gear; wiry body, thin body, round body}

    \item \textbf{Choose 2 Contacts} \\
    Wage mage, ork underground, gang thug, street cop, herbalist, university professor, diner owner, fetishmonger, art dealer, hedge wizard, houngan
    
    \item \textbf{Establish Debts and Favors} \\
    Place one of your fellow runners’ names in at least one of the blanks below:
        \begin{easylist}
            ## \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ had me in his sights, and let me live.
            ## \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ put their life on the line helping me battle a wild spirit.
            ## When \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ fell foul of that corp hit squad, I provided additional security.
            ## Getting the artifact \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ wanted wasn’t easy.
        \end{easylist}
    
    \item \textbf{Starting Funds} \\

    \item \textbf{Starting Moves} \\
    You know all the Core and Secondary Moves. You know the Conjure and Banish moves.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{SHAMAN MOVES}
\paragraph{Conjure -} When you summon a spirit, spend at least 1 essence and roll. The stat you add to the roll depends on the spirit’s nature:
    \begin{easylist}
        # Destroyer: roll+Hard
        # Protector: roll+Steady
        # Watcher: roll+Sharp
        # Teacher: roll+Skilled
        # Seducer: roll+Smooth
    \end{easylist}

On 10+, the spirit is conjured and will perform a number of moves equal to the essence spent. On 7-9, the spirit is conjured, but (choose 1):
    \begin{easylist}
        # It can perform one fewer moves (you cannot choose this option if you spent only 1 essence)
        # It is draining; take 1 stun
        # You must expose yourself to danger or an attack
    \end{easylist}

When the spirit has used all of its moves, you regain the essence committed to the summoning. If the spirit is destroyed, you regain half the committed essence, round down.

On a failure, the spirit does not manifest, and the essence spent is lost. If you roll snake eyes, the spirit is summoned in an uncontrolled state, and the GM will control its actions until it is exhausted or banished.

\paragraph{Banish -} when you attempt to banish a spirit, roll+Hard. On 10+, you reduce the spirit’s available moves by 1. On 7-9, you reduce the spirit’s moves by 1, but it deals half its damage to you. If you reduce the spirit’s available moves to 0, it vanishes immediately.

\paragraph{Commune -} when you take a moment to mentally commune with your totem, you may gain its boons and flaws, or regain 1d6 essence.

\paragraph{Favored Spirit -} choose 1 spirit type (Watcher, Teacher, Protector, Destroyer, Seducer). This spirit type performs one free move.

\paragraph{Aura Mask -} you may conceal your magical nature. Roll+Skilled. On 10+, you appear to be a mundane individual to anyone or anything that examines you. On 7-9, you appear mundane, but must spend 1 Essence to do so.

\paragraph{Spirit Master -} you may conjure multiple spirits simultaneously, dividing the commited Essence among them.

\section{Debts \& Favors}

In your life before and after becoming a shadowrunner, you’ve worked with a lot of people, and ended up owing, or being owed, by them. These relationships include at least one of your fellow shadowrunners, and are described by debts and favors. When you are instructed to create your debts and favors with fellow runners, you’ll see a list of sample statements to help you create them. You don’t have to use these; they’re simply suggestions.
    
To create a debt or favor, place the name of one of the other characters in the blank space in one of the statements presented. You can place the same name more than once (that is, in more than one sentence), but you must establish at least one debt or favor to start with. Collectively, debts and favors are known as Bond. Later, during play, you may end up resolving a bond with someone. If you do, both of you receive Karma.
