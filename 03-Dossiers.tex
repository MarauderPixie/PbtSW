\chapter{Dossiers} \label{dossiers}

Creating a character is a multi-step process (don’t worry, though, it’s pretty easy). The overall process is described here; more detail is provided in each Archetype’s dossier. You’ll record the details you create on the dossier page or the supplemental “extra info” page.

\begin{enumerate}
\item CHOOSE YOUR ARCHETYPE \\
There are 10 Archetypes to choose from: Adept, Face, Ex-Cop, Decker, Mage, Mercenary, Rigger, Shaman, Street Doc, and Street Samurai. You can learn more about them in the Dossiers that follow.

\item CHOOSE YOUR METATYPE AND LOOK \\
There are 5 metatypes: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Ork, and Troll. Each metatype offers a choice of Metatype Moves.

\item CHOOSE YOUR LOOK \\
Each character archetype will present options for look; you are free to make up your own as well.

\item CHOOSE YOUR NAME AND STREET NAME \\
Pick a real name and street name. You may use the lists provided in the GM Resources, or create your own.

\item ASSIGN YOUR STATS \\
All characters have the following stats:
Sharp: alertness, perception, and instinct
Hard: coldness, ruthlessness, and willingness to do harm
Steady: focus, cool, and mental and physical toughness
Smooth: style, appeal, charisma, and influence
Skilled: training, education, and learned abilities
All stats star with a value of +0.

\item SPEND YOUR BUILD POINTS \\
You have 4 build points to distribute among your stats. To increase a stat by 1 point costs 1 Build Point (e.g., it is a straight 1-for-1 cost). You may increase a stat to a maximum of +2 as a starting character. Additionally, if you wish, you may lower one stat to -1 in order to gain an additional Build Point to spend elsewhere.

\item RECORD EQUIPMENT \\
Each archetype will present various weapon, spell, cyberware, and equipment options. Choose one item from each list (unless the list indicates that you may choose more than one item). Some choices, particularly cyberware, are optional.

\item DETERMINE YOUR ESSENCE AND Edge \\
Your starting Essence is equal to 6 – the Essence cost of any cyberware you have installed or choose to install. Your starting Edge is zero.

\item CHOOSE CONTACTS \\
Everybody knows somebody. You will be presented with a list of potential contacts your character might know as a result of their experiences both before and after they became shadowrunners.

\item ESTABLISH DEBTS AND FAVORS \\
In your life before and after becoming a shadowrunner, you’ve worked with a lot of people, and ended up owing, or being owed, by them.

These relationships include at least one of your fellow shadowrunners, and are called debts and favors. When you are instructed to create your debts and favors with fellow runners, you’ll see a list of sample statements to help you create them. You don’t have to use these; they’re simply suggestions.

To create a debt or favor, place the name of one of the other characters in the blank space in one of the statements presented. You can place the same name more than once (that is, in more than one sentence), but you must establish at least one debt or favor to start with. Collectively, debts and favors are known as Bond. Later, during play, you may end up resolving a bond with someone. If you do, both of you receive Karma.

\item STARTING MOVES \\
Your character knows all the Core and Secondary Moves. You character also knows one or more of his or her Archetype moves. If you are given an option to choose additional moves, check off the box next to them on the character sheet.

\item ADVANCEMENT \\
Each time you fail a roll - that is, you roll a 6 or less - you receive Karma. When you mark 5 Karma, and you have downtime, you can make the Advance move.
\end{enumerate}

When the spirit has used all of its moves, you regain the essence committed to the summoning. If the spirit is destroyed, you regain half the committed essence, round down.

On a failure, the spirit does not manifest, and the essence spent is lost. If you roll snake eyes, the spirit is summoned in an uncontrolled state, and the GM will control its actions until it is exhausted or banished.

Banish: when you attempt to banish a spirit, roll+Hard. On 10+, you reduce the spirit’s available moves by 1. On 7-9, you reduce the spirit’s moves by 1, but it deals half its damage to you. If you reduce the spirit’s available moves to 0, it vanishes immediately.

Commune: when you take a moment to mentally commune with your totem, you may gain its boons and flaws, or regain 1d6 essence.

Favored Spirit: choose 1 spirit type (Watcher, Teacher, Protector, Destroyer, Seducer). This spirit type performs one free move.

Aura Mask: you may conceal your magical nature. Roll+Skilled. On 10+, you appear to be a mundane individual to anyone or anything that examines you. On 7-9, you appear mundane, but must spend 1 Essence to do so.

Spirit Master: you may conjure multiple spirits simultaneously, dividing the commited Essence among them.
