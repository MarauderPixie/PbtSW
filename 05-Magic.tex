\chapter{Magic} \label{magic}

In the Sixth World, the magic has returned to the world, and dormant powers have reawakened. Magic is fueled by Essence, one of the variable point pools each character has.



\section{The Awakening of Metahumanity} % oder so. ESSENCE und ESSENCE RECOVERY sind zumindest keine eigenen sections...

\subsection{Essence}
Three archetypes in the game - the Adept, the Mage, and the Shaman - are magically gifted, which means that they are able to spend their Essence to use their magical abilities.

\textbf{The Adept:} adepts turn their magical ability inward to improve themselves, sometimes to superhuman levels. An adept spends essence to temporarily modify his or her capabilities (for example the Enhanced Ability or Killing Hands moves).

\textbf{The Mage:} when a mage spends essence to power a spell, the player marks off the spent essence. That essence is not available for future spells until it is recovered. The amount of essence spent is a general indicator of the power, or Force, of the spell.

\textbf{The Shaman:} when a shaman spends Essence to summon a spirit or elemental, they are in effect committing or wagering some amount of essence to do so.

The Essence spent indicates the number of services the spirit will perform (mechanically, the number of moves the spirit may make before dissipating). A Shaman allocates this essence at the time of summoning. If the summoning fails, the wagered essence is lost. If the summoning succeeds, then the essence is “tied up” until the spirit is dispelled/destroyed.


\subsection{Essence Recovery}

All magic users may recover essence by resting. A substantial rest (usually a night’s sleep) will recover all Essence spent. Some archetypes have additional means of recovering essence, as described below:

\textbf{The Mage:} mages may use the Center move to recover some Essence without resting, simply by taking a moment to concentrate and recenter him- or herself.

\textbf{The Shaman:} because the essence used to summon a spirit is in effect a wager, when the spirit has performed its actions (or is dispelled by the shaman who summoned it), the essence “tied up” in the spirit immediately returns to the shaman. If the spirit is dispelled by another person, or destroyed, only half the wagered essence (round up) is recovered.



\section{Astral Space}

Much like the Matrix, Astral Space is a sort of alternate universe adjacent to our own. It is where spells, spirits, magical creatures, wards and more reside. When an individual perceives the Astral, they can see the entities existing in Astral Space. All three arcane archetypes can astrally perceive. In addition, they can perceive emotional auras of living beings, as well as background magical nature of the area. When an individual projects themselves into astral space, they transfer their consciousness from their physical body to the astral plane, and can fully interact with other Astral entities and traverse great distances. The Shaman and Mage can astrally project. The following effects occur while perceiving or projecting: 

\textbf{Perceiving:} while astrally perceiving, take -2 ongoing to any moves in the physical world.

\textbf{Projecting:} you cannot take action in the physical world (your body is unconscious and helpless).



\section{Astral Quests}

The Astral also serves as a huge deposit of magical information, though most of the deepest knowledge is hidden in the metaplanes. Metaplanes are the planes beyond the Astral, the real sources of all magic. Every metaplane has a citadel, a core of pure magical energy that can alter the magical world. Accessing it can let you destroy a spirit permanently, learn some information such as the true name of a spirit, or learn an individual’s true aura. Note, however, an astral quest may only have a single goal. Astral Quests are also dangerous in that you are stuck in a metaplane until you either complete your Quest or fail. You can’t give up, and you can never go back, only forward.


\subsection{Domains}
To go on an Astral Quest, you must visit various metalocations known as domains, similar to Nodes in the Matrix (in fact, mapping these domains is a useful tool to keep play on track and engaging). The number and nature of these domains depends on the quest you are undertaking, but each one presents a challenge the character must complete in order to move on to the next domain. This could be fierce combat, a riddle, a puzzle or any variety of things.

Minor quests usually have 3 or 4 domains, while major quests can have up to 10 or more, all of which lead, ultimately, to the Citadel, where the quester will find the object or information they seek. Moving from domain to domain is as simple as willing yourself there once the task in the current domain is completed.


\subsection{The Dweller}
The first domain you encounter is always the Domain of the Dweller, a mystical being who blocks the entrance to the metaplanes. The Dweller knows everything about the quester, and will always question the nature your quest before granting passage. The Dweller is an enigmatic trickster, but if you go on quests often, you’ll get to know this being quite well.






\section{Spells}

Like other equipment, spells (although they’re not exactly “equipment”) are described in terms of tags. Spells has the following special tag:
Essence: the minimum Essence expenditure required to cast the spell.

\section{Spirits}

Spirits are the companions and tools of the Shaman, who summons them from the astral plane to perform services for him. Spirits have the following special tags: aspect: the spirit takes on the appearance of their domain, and is invisible in their domain unless it chooses to be seen. Elementals automatically gain this tag, otherwise it requires 1 spirit point.

earth: a spirit who dwells in the earth, caves, or landscape; earth spirits are widespread
elemental: these spirits represent the basic four elements, air, earth, fire, and water, and can be summoned anywhere.

\subsection{Spirit Moves}

Spirits are independent entities, and have thier own moves. Their moves correspond to the harm, search, guard, enthrall, and mentor tags.

Harm: When a spirit attacks someone or something, roll+Harm. On 10+, the spirit deals its damage. On 7-9, the spirit deals damage, but also takes damage.

Search: When the spirit attempts to locate individuals or items within its domain, roll+Search. On 10+, the spirit locates the item and can tell the Shaman where it is. On 7-9, the spirit can tell the shaman whether the item or person is within its domain, but not it’s specific location. Note: the GM and player should determine the search range for elementals.

Guard: When a spirit stands in defense of its domain or inhabitants thereof, roll+Guard. On 10+, the spirit prevents damage or hostile effects from occurring. On 7-9, the spirit halves damage or the potency of a hostile effect.

Enthrall: When a spirit attempts to control someone’s actions or thoughts, roll+Enthrall. If the target is:

    An NPC: On a 10+, the spirit issues two instructions that the NPC must follow, or take 3 damage. On 7-9, the spirit may issue one instruction.

    A PC: On a 10+, both of the following apply. On 7-9, only 1 applies:

    If the character complies, they mark XP

    If the characer refuses, they must Stay Frosty

Mentor: When a spirit imparts knowledge or truth, roll+Mentor. On 10+, the GM provides, in secrete, a useful or interesting piece of information to the target. On 7-9, the GM provides an interesting piece of information.


\subsection{Spirit Examples}
There are 5 general spirit natures: Watchers simply observe and report. Teachers seek to instruct and guide others, but are reluctant to do harm. Protectors seek to defend their domain and its inhabitants, while Destroyers seek battle, blood, and vengeance. Finally, Seducer spirits desire control and devotion.

\subsubsection{Elementals}
Fire Elemental (destroyer, aspect, harm 2, search -1, guard 1, enthrall 1, mentor 0, dmg 1d10, armor 2, wounds 9)

Earth Elemental (protector, aspect, harm 1, search 2, guard 2, enthrall -1, mentor 0, dmg 1d8, armor 1, wounds 10)

\subsubsection{Nature Spirits}
Forest Protector (natural, forest, harm 1, search 1, guard 2, enthrall -1, mentor 0, dmg 1d8, aspect, armor 1, wounds 8)

Forest Watcher (natural, forest, search 3, guard 0, enthrall 1, mentor 1, aspect, armor 1, wounds 6, special: may not Harm)

\subsection{Creating New Spirits}
The spirits above are just examples; the procedures that follow describe how to “build” a new spirit to suit your preferences.

Choose the spirit’s Type: elemental or nature.

Choose the spirit’s Domain, and record the base Armor and Wounds.

Choose the spirit’s Nature, and modify the basic spirit tags as needed.

Distribute 4 spirit points among spirit’s Moves, adjusting for the spirit’s purpose. No spirit move may have a modifier higher than +3.

Add additional tags if desired (see Other Spirit Tags).

\textbox{Example}{Pam is playing a Shaman named Chert and is developing the initial three spirits Chert can summon. Pam decides the first one will be a nature spirit of the forest, a protector of the dwindling unspoiled lands. With those decisions made, the spirit’s qualities so far are nature, forest, protector, armor 1, wounds 10, dmg 1d8, guard 1, enthrall -1. \\ \\
Pam also wants the spirit to blend in with the forest and to be an excellent guardian of its inhabitants. She spends one spirit point (out of 4) to gain the aspect tag, and then spends the remaining three to boost the Guard move twice, and the Harm move once. \\ \\
The final spirit looks like this: nature, forest, protector, harm 2, guard 3, search 0, enthrall -1, mentor 0, armor 1, wounds 10.}


\subsection{Spirit Types}
Elemental: these spirits represent the basic four elements, air, earth, fire, and water, and can be summoned anywhere.

Nature: natural spirits are spirits associated with particular domains (such as “city spirits” or “mountain spirits”). Natural spirits may enter other domains freely, but they can only be summoned within their own, and if they cross domains, there’s always a chance they attract unwanted attention from other spirits who don’t like intruders.

\subsubsection{Basic Spirit Tags}
Domain represents the spirit’s preferred environment or the area in which it may be summoned. A natural spirit summoned in its domain always has the generous tag. The domain of an elemental is considered to be the same as its element (though they gain no benefit from being within their domain).

Urban: spirits that dwell in urban or developed lands, especially cities

Plains: spirits that dwell in open plains, grasslands, open fields, and farms

Forest: spirits that dwell in forests, woods, and similar areas

Mountain: spirits that dwell in foothills, crags, ridges, and other mountainous terrain

Earth: spirits that dwell underground or in caves; the domains of earth spirits are widespread.

Deserts: spirits that dwell in the sere, forbidding landscape of the deserts

Sky: spirits dwelling in the open skies.

Storm: spirits of storm and disruption

Swamps: spirits who dwell where earth and water are one

Water: spirits of the water, be it lakes, rivers, or the open sea

There are two things to be aware of regarding domains. First, domains are relatively confined—a mountain spirit’s domain is not all mountains, nor even all of a specific mountain. Rather, it is usually a region with a radius of around 250 meters, within a mountainous region. Overlap among domains is possible, and the byzantine negotiations that take place between spirits defy understanding even by the most gifted shamans.

Also remember that multiple domains may exist within a larger area that seems uniform. In other words, city spirits (for example) are the only kind of spirit you’ll run across in a city—a park within a city may be the home of a forest spirit, and you may find a river spirit fighting to protect it’s home from polluted runoff in some industrial area.

Armor represents the spirit’s innate magical resistance to damage; spirit armor cannot be ignored, nor reduced by weapons. All spirits have 1 armor.

Wounds simply represent the spirit’s innate health; all spirits, by default, have 8 wounds.


\subsection{Spirit Nature}
Every spirit has a nature, which indicates its sense of purpose and the activities to which it is drawn. A spirit’s nature also affects its basic tags and moves (see Spirit Moves, below) in various ways.

Watcher spirits observe, find, and note. They are incapable of dealing harm to anyone or anything. Watcher spirits have the following modifiers: Search +2, Wounds -2, may not Harm.

Teacher spirits wish to inform and instruct, and find it difficult to inflict damage upon those they could otherwise teach. Teacher spirits have the following modifiers: Mentor +2, Harm -2, dmg 1d4.

Protector spirits preserve, defend, and support their domain. They are unconcerned with influencing intruders, preferring to throw them out instead. Protector spirits have the following modifiers: Guard +1, Enthrall -1, Wounds +2, dmg 1d8.

Destroyer spirits are warrior spirits who revel in combat and bloodletting. They are fearsome enemies, though somewhat limited in imagination. Destroyer spirits have the following modifiers: Harm +2, Mentor -1, Search -2, Wounds +1, Armor +1, dmg 1d10.

Seducer spirits wish to influence, to inspire love, and to acquire servants, though they do not typically enjoy directly harming others. Seducer spirits have the following modifiers: Enthrall +2, Harm -1, Wounds -1, dmg 1d4.


\subsection{Other Spirit Tags}
Robust: the spirit is particularly resistant to damage; all damage rolls against it are [w]. Adding this tag costs 1 spirit point.

Aspect: the spirit takes on the appearance of their domain, and is invisible in their domain unless it chooses to be seen. All spirits have this tag.

Generous: the spirit will perform one extra move; adding this tag costs 1 spirit point.

Insubstantial: damage dealt and taken is halved Weakness (specify): the spirit has a weakness to a particular material or element which ignores insubstantiality, armor, and robustness. Adding this tag allows the free addition of another tag.

Engulf: the spirit may enclose a target in the substance of its domain, typically (but not always) dealing damage.

Wild: this spirit has an extra spirit point, but the shaman must take -2 whenever he or she conjures it.
