\chapter{Gear} \label{Gear}

In this section you’ll find example equipment (weapons, cyberdecks, vehicles, etc.) available in the Sixth World. This isn’t an exhaustive list of what’s available; rather, they’re just samples of some classic items to help you get playing quickly.
EXAMPLE GEAR

Equipment—like many items in Sixth World—is described in terms of tags, which are short keywords that indicate various capabilities or qualities. Certain tags apply to multiple kinds of equipment (such as obvious, supply, or armor). Tags that only apply to specific kinds of equipment are described in the listing of that kind of item. The following tags apply to multiple types of equipment.

2-hand: this item must be used with both hands
armor +n: grants a +n bonus to existing armor
armor n: grants n Armor (for vehicles or drones, indicates armor rating, and is abbreviated arm)
arcane: can only be used by magical archetypes
area: affects multiple targets
avail: the availability of the item on the shadow markets
+bonus: grants a bonus to a particular move; e.g. +1 to Stay Frosty
conceal: this weapon or item is easily hidden and will not be spotted by enemies
damage n: the amount of damage a weapon or other item deals. Abbreviated dmg
heal n: restores n wounds
ignores armor: bypasses the target’s armor
loud: noisy and audible to anyone with functionin hearing; for weapons, it means the weapon cannot be suppressed
messy: deals damage in a particularly gruesome way
obvious: cannot be concealed, or is immediately visible to any observer
range: the range(s) at which the weapon or other attack is effective. Ranges are touch (t), close (c), short (s), medium (m), and long (l).
shock: the weapon deals electrical shock
special (description): if the effect of the item requires explanation, use this tag.
stun: this weapon or attack deals Stun damage only
subtle: not easily noticed (as opposed to conceal, which means it is unnoticeable)
Supply n: the amount of supplies or uses you can get out of an item. Each use of the item consumes 1 supply (unless otherwise stated).
WEAPONS

The tags below apply to weapons. Feel free to customize the example equipment with these tags (subject to GM approval) to create your own gear, or recreate classic gear from Shadowrun.

ARMOR

Armor provides protection against incoming attack, reducing the damage dealt by the armor value. Armor of the same type (e.g inherent) does not stack. Armor of differing types can stack. Armor has the following unique tags:
inherent: this armor is either implanted, or occurs naturally. Cyberware armor is inherent armor.
worn: this armor is worn on the body
mystic: this armor is magical in nature

Combat Armor (3 armor, obvious, 2,500¥)
Form-fitting Armor (armor 1, conceal, 550¥)
Riot Shield (armor 2, occupies one hand, 700¥)
CYBERWARE

Cyberware works slightly differently from other equipment. Instead of simply being something that has some tags or stats, each piece of cyberware provides new moves or modifies existing moves, based on the augmentation’s function.

Adding cyberware costs essence, which does have a significant effect on magic users, so magic archetypes who choose cyberware do so at the cost of their magical potency.

When you have downtime, you may elect to have cyberware installed. Installation and recovery from cybersurgery takes a number of days equal to 3 x Essence cost of the implant.
CONTAINERS

The listed essence costs assume that the augmentation is directly implanted into the body. However, full-replacement cyberware (such as cybereyes, cyberears, and cyberarms) have the capacity to hold other implants without costing additional essence. Each of these items can hold additional augmentations equal to 1 + their Essence cost (for example, cybereyes cost 1 essence, and therefore can contain up to 2 essence worth of additional augmentations).
HEADWARE

MAGICAL SUPPLIES
FOCI

A focus is a mundane item that has been imbued with an astral construct. When used by someone to which it is attuned, a focus helps them channel astral power greatly enhances their abilities.
ATTUNING

Before a focus can be used, the user must attune themselves to it. To do so, they must invest at least one point of essence into the focus. Essence committed in this fashion remains spent until the user de-attunes themselves from the focus, or the focus is destroyed, at which point the essence is recovered.
TYPES OF FOCI

Spell Focus: a spell focus enhances the casting of a specific spell. When attuned, the mage using the spell focus has hold equal to the Essence spent attuing the focus. Spend this hold toward casting that specific spell.

Spirit Focus: a spirit focus enhances the summoning of a specific type of spirit. When attuned, the shaman has hold equal to the essence invested in the focus toward summoning that specific spirit type.

Weapon Focus: weapon foci are primarily used by adepts. When attuned to a weapon focus, the adept using it has hold equal to the invested Essence to spend on the Rock \& Roll move or on dealing damage.
CREATING A FOCUS

Although foci may be purchased from fetishmongers, street contacts, and other sources, sometimes a magic user wishes to create one of their own. To do so, the user must spend two days researching and preparing the object, at the end of which they make the Imbue Focus move:

Imbue Focus: When you imbue astral power into an object to create a focus, roll+Skilled. On 10+, the focus is created normally. On 7-9, the focus is weakly imbued, and requires one additional Essence point to attune (this essence does not count toward the Hold granted by the focus.)
FETISHES

Fetishes are essentially one-shot magical supplies— small mundane objects imbued with structure and energy of a spell or summon a spirit, needing only to be triggered by the mage or shaman.
INVESTING

To create a fetish, the mage or shaman decides what spell or spirit to place into the fetish, and then invests the fetish with power, spending the Essence required for the spell, or the essence they wish to provide to the spirit. Essence invested in a fetish in this manner remains spent until the fetish is used, at which point it immediately returns.
ACTIVATING A FETISH

Normally, to cast a spell or summon a spirit, the mage or shaman must make the Cast a Spell or Conjure moves. With a fetish, this is no longer the case: instead, they can simply declare that they’re using it (making any other moves that the fiction would dictate of course, for instance, Stay Frosty). Once triggered, the stored spell or spirit is immediately cast or conjured. The fetish is good for a single use, after which it crumbles to dust.
