\section{Beta}

\subsection*{beta v0.2}
\begin{easylist}
    # add knowledge skills to character creation
    # clarified Mage's \move{Center} move
    # return \move{Stay Frosty} (instead of Null Sweat; turns out that by merits of grammar alone, SF is actually just a better fit)
    # change essence cost of Dermal Plating (from 2 to 1) and Wired Reflexes (3 to 2)
\end{easylist}

\subsection*{beta v0.2}
\begin{easylist}
    # gear adjustments:
        ## removed and renamed a bunch of tags
        ## Combat Knife now does 1d6 dmg (from 2d4b)
        ## fists/kicks now deal 1d4 dmg (from 1d6)
        ## reduced hold-out ammo to 2 (from 3)
    # added descriptions from Shadowhelix to totems 
    # rework the Spells section:
        ## to keep in line with Shadowrun (6E), the Mana Barrier spell doesn't physically block living beings anymore
        ## minor adjustments to spells, mostly essence costs (e.g. to light and invisibility) and wording (damage spells)
        ## removed range categories of spells for the most part / changed to how it's done in SR
\end{easylist}

\section{Alpha}

\subsection*{aplha}
\begin{easylist}
# did some restructuring of Debts \& Favors in the character creation
# renamed "Stay Frosty" to "Null Sweat" ...or should I?
# renamed "Investing Fetishes" to "Infusing"
# \textbf{lots} of minor proof reading, corrections, streamlining, etc in the Gear chapter

# renamed 'Natural Spirits' to 'Nature Spirits'
# minor changes (mostly condensing) to Dossiers

# changed 'mark XP' to 'receive Karma' (in chapters 1-3)
# changed 'Karma' to 'Edge' (in chapters 1-3), as is customary when doing this
# changed 'Hacker' to 'Decker'; that's just how we roll (talking about respecting the canon...)

# minor semantics
\end{easylist}
